## Smart Home Device System
📋 ## Project Overview
A C++ object-oriented programming demonstration implementing a smart home device management system using inheritance and polymorphism.

🏗️ ## Architecture
Device (Abstract Base Class): Core class with common attributes (ID, name, manufacturer)

SecurityCamera: Manages security cameras with quality and power settings

AirConditioning: Controls AC units with temperature adjustment functionality

🔧 Key Features
Polymorphic Design: Abstract base class with pure virtual function for device interactions

Inheritance Hierarchy: Specialized device classes extending base functionality

Interactive Components: User input for device configuration (temperature control for AC units)

Resource Management: Proper memory handling with virtual destructors

🎯 Learning Objectives
Object-oriented programming principles

Inheritance and polymorphism implementation

Abstract base classes with pure virtual functions

Memory management in polymorphic hierarchies

User interaction with class methods

💻 Technical Implementation
Language: C++ 11+

Core Concepts:

Abstract base classes

Virtual functions and method overriding

Constructor initialization lists

Dynamic memory allocation with proper cleanup
